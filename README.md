Develop a basic implementation of the PriceListener interface that provides the following behaviour:

1. Monitors price movements on a specified single stock (e.g. "IBM")
1. Executes a single "buy" instruction for a specified number of lots (e.g. 100) as soon as the price of that stock is seen to be below
a specified price (e.g. 55.0). Donâ€™t worry what units that is in.

Implemented PriceListnerImpl class priceUpdate() method and Trading strategey class.
Corresponding Junit testcases are completed.
